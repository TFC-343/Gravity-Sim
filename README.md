# Gravity-Sim
small gravity sim in processing

Thanks for downloading this project, to run it you will need "Processing" a fun coding language based of java,
<br> Or you will need to run the executabes in the bin folder, this is still dependant of the users having Java, specifally OpenJDK 17.

The "pde" files are plaintext do if you don't have processing you can still look at the sourse code.
